[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/stixview.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/stixview)

[stixview](https://github.com/traut/stixview) is an embeddable STIX2 graph library.

In addition, [jupyter-widget-stixview](https://github.com/traut/jupyter-widget-stixview) is a Jupyter notebook widget that uses stixview to render STIX2 graphs.

## Motivation

CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) is very much about telling stories. Information becomes intelligence when it is complimented with a context and is placed in a story. These stories are usually crystallised in the reports by an intelligence provider and disseminated to the customers.

If intelligence provider cares about structured machine-readable CTI, the reports produced will be supplemented with [STIX2](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) bundles. There is a gap there between a story, narrated in a report, and a structured CTI snapshot, represented by a STIX2 bundle.

The objective of [stixview](https://github.com/traut/stixview) library is to provide easily embeddable STIX2 graphs with necessary level of interactivity, so that CTI community can create informative and engaging stories.


## Demos

To see stixview in action, take a look at these demo pages:
* [STIX2.1 demo](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/stix21-demo.html) — sample graph with all STIX 2.1 objects.
* [Storyline](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/story.html) — multiple graphs per page, rendering selected entities from the same STIX bundle.
* [Viewer](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/viewer.html) — graph viewer with custom controls.
* [Drag-n-drop](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/drag-n-drop.html) — graph views with drag-n-drop enabled.
* [Dark theme graph from inline data](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/load-data.html) — rendering graph from inline STIX2 bundle and custom styling.
* [Examples of various configuration settings](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/misc.html)


## Usage

To use stixview in a browser, download the latest build from `dist` directory (`stixview.bundle.js`) and reference it from your HTML file:

```html
<script src="stixview.bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

or use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) CDN service:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/stixview/dist/stixview.bundle.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```


## API

The library relies heavily on [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes).
On page load, stixview will find all HTML elements with `data-stix-gist-id`, `data-stix-url` or `data-stix-allow-dragdrop` set and use these elements as graph holders.

Example of a graph holder div:
```html
<div data-stix-gist-id="6a0fbb0f6e7faf063c748b23f9c7dc62"
     data-show-sidebar=true
     data-disable-mouse-zoom=true
     data-graph-width=500
     data-graph-height=300>
</div>
```

### Data attributes

Every holder element _must have_ one of `data-stix-gist-id`, `data-stix-url` or `data-stix-allow-dragdrop` set, otherwise it will not be detected by the library.

stixview supports these `data-` attributes:

`stix-gist-id` — id of a gist that contains STIX2 bundle. if `gist-file` is not specified, first file will be used.

`gist-file` — name of a file from gist to be used as STIX2 bundle. Only used if `stix-gist-id` is set.

`stix-url` — URL pointing to a remote STIX2 bundle JSON file.

`stix-allow-dragdrop` (`false` by default) — enable ability to drag-n-drop STIX2 bundle into the graph element. If this property is set to `true` and `stix-gist-id` and `stix-url` are not specified, empty graph will be rendered.

`caption` — a title of the graph. Header is not shown if `caption` is not set.

`hide-footer` (`false` by default) — hide graph footer with a download link to STIX2 bundle.

`show-sidebar` (`false` by default) — enable a sidebar with object details, opened when object is clicked on.

`show-idrefs` (`false` by default) — show placeholder objects for ids mentioned in the relationships but not present in a bundle.

`graph-layout` (`cola` by default) — name of the graph layout algorythm. Supported algorythms are `cola` , `klay`, `cose-bilkent`, and `dagre`.

`disable-mouse-zoom` (`false` by default) — disable mouse wheel zoom.

`disable-panning` (`false` by default) — disable panning in the graph, making graph view fixed. Users will still be able to drag nodes around.

`disable-labels` (`false` by default) — disable node labels.

`show-markings` (`false` by default) — render `marking-definition` objects. These objects are usually heavily connected, so skipping them improves graph readability.

`highlighted-objects` — a string with comma-separated STIX2 ids. If set, graph will contain _only objects with ids listed_.

`hidden-objects` — a string with comma-separated STIX2 ids. If set, objects with ids listed will be skipped and not rendered in the graph.

`min-zoom` (`0.3` by default) — minimum allowed zoom.

`max-zoom` (`2.5` by default) — maximum allowed zoom.

`graph-width` (all available width by default) — width of a graph element. Both pixel and % values are supported (see misc demo page for an example).

`graph-height` (`600` pixels by default) — height of a graph element. Both pixel and % values are supported (see misc demo page for an example).


### Browser object

The library, when used in a browser, will register `stixview` variable on `window` object with these properties:

`registry` — a registry of graphs initiated on a page.

`onInit(selector, callback)` – listener hook for graph's init event on a DOM element that matches provided `selector` value (see [demo](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/viewer.html) for usage example). Callback receive instance of a graph interface.

`onLoad(selector, callback)` – listener hook for graph's load event on a DOM element that matches provided `selector` value (see [demo](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/viewer.html) for usage example). Callback receive instance of a graph interface.

`init(element, properties, initCallback, loadCallback)` — method that initiates a graph view in specified `element` with provided `properties` that override defaults (see [demo](https://traut.github.io/stixview/dist/demos/load-data.html) for usage example).


### Graph object

Graph is an object with properties:

`cy` – [cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org) graph object.

`element` — DOM element that holds a graph.

`options` – configured graph options.

`runLayout(name)` — run specific layout on a graph.

`enableLabels()` — enable labels in a graph.

`disableLabels()` — disable labels in a graph.

`fit()` — fit graph fully into a graph view.

`showIdrefs(callback)` — show idref placeholders on a graph. This will trigger layout recalculation. Callback is triggered when layout algorithm finishes.

`hideIdrefs(callback)` — hide idref placeholders on a graph. This will trigger layout recalculation. Callback is triggered when layout algorithm finishes.

`loadData(data)` — load STIX2 bundle from `data` JSON object and render on a graph.

`loadDataFromFile(file)` — load STIX2 bundle from `file` file object and render on a graph.

`loadDataFromUrl(url)` — load STIX2 bundle from remote URL and render on a graph.

`loadDataFromParamUrl(paramName)` — load STIX2 bundle from remote URL, configured in HTTP GET paramter with name in `paramName` and render on a graph.
